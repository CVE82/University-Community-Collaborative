  expertise: "Ancient Greek, Mythology and mythography, Greeks in the Roman world, Topography"
  bio: "Daniel W. Berman, Professor and Chair, earned his B.A. from the University of Michigan and his Ph.D. from Yale, both in Classics. His research interests include archaic and classical Greek poetry and myth, mythography, Greeks in the Roman world, and topography and ancient geography. His current research project, “Rome in Greek,” focuses on Greek writers’ representations of the city of Rome during the Principate. His most recent book, Myth, Literature, and the Creation of the Topography of Thebes (Cambridge 2015) explores how Greek mythic texts construct and represent the urban environment of Greek Thebes. He has published articles on the Greek mythographers, Aeschylus, the city of Thebes, the Dirce spring, and related subjects, and also one on herdsmen in Theocritus. His first book, Myth and Culture in Aeschylus’ Seven Against Thebes, was published in 2007 by Edizioni dell’Ateneo, and he is translator from French of a book by Claude Calame, Myth and History in Ancient Greece: The Symbolic Creation of a Colony (Princeton 2003). Dan teaches courses in Greek and Latin language and literature, classical myth, and ancient civilization and culture. He also maintains a teaching interest in Roman archaeology and topography. In 2012-2013 he was Andrew W. Mellon Professor-In-Charge at the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies in Rome, where he had taught previously as an assistant professor in 2001-2002 and was also lucky enough to study as an undergraduate."

  expertise: "Classical political thought, Greek literature, Greek culture, Greek history"
  bio: "My work ranges widely from Solon and Homer to myth and ritual, from Plato to Athenian political history. The thread that connects these disparate topics is a continuing fascination with the forms and modes of ancient Greek political thought and practice, broadly conceived. The overarching agenda of my research is to widen the scope of what constitutes the study of Greek politics, in order to better understand ancient behavior and mentalities."

  expertise: "Roman wedding, Roman religion, Gender in ancient Rome, Imperial Latin Literature, Tanaquil"
  bio: "Karen Klaiber Hersch, Associate Professor, was the grateful recipient of an Arthur Ross Pre-Doctoral Fellowship from the American Academy in Rome (2000-1). Dr. Hersch’s research interests are Roman religion, Roman social history, gender in antiquity and imperial Latin literature. Her book The Roman Wedding: Ritual and Meaning in Antiquity (Cambridge University Press, 2010) focuses on a ceremony that in its continual reenactment provided for every observer an education on societal expectations for each Roman man and woman, urban or rural, rich or poor, slave or free, literate or illiterate. Dr. Hersch’s articles include examinations of the uniquely independent bride Violentilla in Statius’ Silvae as well as aspects of ethnicity in Roman bridal costume. She is currently at work on an article focusing on depictions of violence in Greek and Roman nuptial ritual, as well as a monograph entitled Tanaquil: Myth and Reality, in which she studies ancient accounts of the life of Tanaquil, Etruscan aristocrat and fifth queen of Rome, a woman said to be a kingmaker, a granter of fertility, and an expert in both divination and woolwork. Dr. Hersch received her B.A. in Classics from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, her M.A. in Classics from Tufts University and her Ph.D. in Classics from Rutgers University. She teaches courses in Latin, Roman literature and culture, gender in antiquity and Greek and Roman religion. Dr. Hersch is adviser of Temple’s chapter (Zeta Beta) of Eta Sigma Phi, the National Classics Honor Society. During 2004-5, Dr. Hersch held a Faculty Fellowship in Temple’s Center for the Humanities, and has recently served on the Board of the Center. She served as President of the Pennsylvania Classical Association in 2006-7. She has been Faculty Mentor to nine Peer Teachers in her Latin, Roman Civilization and Sacred Space classes. She won a Distinguished Faculty Award from the College of Liberal Arts in 2013."
