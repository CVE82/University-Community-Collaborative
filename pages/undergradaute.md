Study the cultures and languages of two major civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean world. You will select from two major concentrations based on your interests and goals: classical civilizations or classical languages and literature. Both options offer a sound liberal arts background—skills in critical thinking, reading, and expressing oneself fluently and with cultural sophistication—that prepares you for success in any career.

## Classics Goes Beyond The Classroom

Our students go abroad to both Greece and Rome, studying in the places that gave birth to some of the world’s greatest scientists, thinkers and artists. They can also spend a  summer on an archaeological dig in the Mediterranean.

## Classics is a Community

Our Classics Club — open to all majors and minors — and our chapter of the national honor society for classics, Eta Sigma Phi, actively meet and hold events like lectures, movie nights and other social activities. Eta Sigma Phi members also attend a spring convention and have the opportunity to win scholarships to study in the Mediterranean.

## Research The Classics

Our faculty and students share a special bond that  transcends the classroom. Advanced majors have  opportunities to assist faculty with research both on-campus and around the world.

## Academic offerings

 - BA in Classics with a Concentration in Classical Civilizations
 - BA in Classics with a Concentration in Classical Languages and Literature
 - Minor in Ancient Mediterranean Studies
 - Minor in Classical Languages and Literature

## Program Overview/Description

Greek and Roman Classics is an interdisciplinary course of study involving languages, history, literature, philosophy, archaeology and art. It is an entire liberal arts education rolled into a single major! The study of Greek and Roman Classics gives students a rigorous education in the nature of language, in the skills of close reading and textual analysis, and in historical reasoning. If you are interested in mythology, in ancient history, in where the major institutions of Western culture began and why some disappeared for a long time, then you are interested in Classics. Our government was inspired by the Greeks yet was modeled on the Roman Republic, which also provided the basis for our laws. Our scientific language is Greek, but our grammar does not make much sense without Latin. Studying Classics at the College of Liberal Arts means discovering how different from us the Greeks and Romans really were. Join us and discover why.

## Degrees and Programs of Study

Temple Classics offers majors in Classical Languages and Literatures and Classical Civilizations, as well as minors in Classical Languages and Ancient Mediterranean Studies.
