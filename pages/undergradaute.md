Study the cultures and languages of two major civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean world. You will select from two major concentrations based on your interests and goals: classical civilizations or classical languages and literature. Both options offer a sound liberal arts background—skills in critical thinking, reading, and expressing oneself fluently and with cultural sophistication—that prepares you for success in any career.

## Classics Goes Beyond The Classroom

Our students go abroad to both Greece and Rome, studying in the places that gave birth to some of the world’s greatest scientists, thinkers and artists. They can also spend a  summer on an archaeological dig in the Mediterranean.

## Classics is a Community

Our Classics Club — open to all majors and minors — and our chapter of the national honor society for classics, Eta Sigma Phi, actively meet and hold events like lectures, movie nights and other social activities. Eta Sigma Phi members also attend a spring convention and have the opportunity to win scholarships to study in the Mediterranean.

## Research The Classics

Our faculty and students share a special bond that  transcends the classroom. Advanced majors have  opportunities to assist faculty with research both on-campus and around the world.
