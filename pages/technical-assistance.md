## Training Institutes

Training Institutes focus on leadership development at the individual, organizational and community levels. Specific content and length vary depending on organizational needs. Below are some examples.

### Youth Leadership Academy

Employing a project-based learning approach, the Institute begins with activities around team building, goal setting, leadership styles, problem solving, and reflection. Building on this foundation, participants then identify, develop and implement a project that addresses some critical issue that they deem relevant to their lives, their schools, the organization in which they are involved, or their community.   During the project phase, they engage in issue identification, message framing, networking and community outreach, and information gathering.   Through this process, participants develop a multitude of skills including: teamwork, program planning, time management, networking, research, communication, critical thinking and public speaking, among others. Institutes typically enroll between 10 and 20 participants. Can be offered during the summer or school year.

### Community Leadership Institute

Designed for community residents of all ages who want to become leaders in their communities, the Institute focuses on key aspects of leadership such as team building, goal setting, leadership styles, problem solving, decision making, active listening, building social networks, conflict management, and reflection; identifying leadership opportunities within the community; community asset mapping; working  across age, race and class; and project development.  Depending on the length of the institute, participants may also plan, develop and implement a community project. Institutes typically enroll between 10 and 20 participants.

### Community Building Institute

Using asset mapping, goal and priority setting, resource identification, networking and planning, the Institute helps organizations and/or public agencies develop strategies for improving their communities. The Institute also addresses key aspects of the implementation process such as effective outreach, team building, leadership development, time management, resource development, communication and collaboration.

### Program Planning and Curriculum Design

Collaborative staff assist with developing age appropriate programming, structuring program modules, developing program goals and objectives, developing and sequencing activities within a curriculum to achieve goals, developing assessment measures, and training staff to implement programs.
