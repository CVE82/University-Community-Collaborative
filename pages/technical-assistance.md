## Building Organizational and Community Capacity
---
Informed by over 18 years of direct programming with older youth (14-24), we work with a wide range of organizations and institutions helping them to:

- Engage older youth through project-based learning, civic engagement, and media production approaches
- Develop age appropriate programming
- Integrate older youth into their organizational structure
- Incorporate media literacy and media production into their programming
- Develop promotional and informational media for their organization, project or campaign

## Sample Workshops
---
**Youth Leadership Development:** Explores youth leadership development by focusing on: defining, recognizing, supporting, and rewarding it.  Examines what it means programmatically and organizationally to have “authentic” youth participation, the role of adults and of youth, the fine lines between “guiding” and “imposing,” the management of perceptions and expectations, and the role of communication.

**Making the Case for Change:** Focuses on how youth can advocate for change. Topics include: problem identification, information gathering, networking and community outreach, message development, framing and delivery, audience identification, persistence and follow through.

**Project Based Learning as a Tool for Engaging Youth:** Explores project based learning as a pedagogical tool for engaging youth. Topics include: learning and motivation theory; project selection, development, management and implementation; tensions between process and product; determining and measuring success.

**Youth Produced Media as a Tool for Leadership Development:** Explores how media, in particular film, can be a tool for youth engagement, youth leadership development, and the development of critical literacies. Explores different types of film production (scripted, documentary, and public service announcement [PSA]) and the benefits of each; the role of stereotyping in media production; the role of media literacy in countering stereotypes and in developing critical literacies; developing venues for film screenings; types of equipment needed.

**Media Production:** Introduces participants to how media is produced. Topics include: choosing and framing your message; identifying your audience; choosing a format; developing content; structuring and conducting interviews; developing venues for screening; using the camera.

**Youth, Media and Identity:** Focuses on how youth are portrayed in the media and how that impacts youth-adult interactions in organizations, institutions and society. Introduces some ways to “decode” media messages.

**Sexual Consent:** Combining film and media literacy activities, these workshops debunk some of the myths around sexual consent, investigate gender stereotypes, and interrogate some of the messages in the larger culture that encourage and condone inappropriate treatment of females. The goals of the workshop are to increase awareness and sensitivity around issues of sexual harassment and violence, and to shift attitudes and hopefully, alter behavior.

**Engaging College Students as Mentors:** Focuses on training, preparing, supporting, and effectively engaging college students as partners, coaches, and mentors for high school students. Topics include: recruiting students; setting goals and expectations; addressing cultural differences; exploring and dealing with assumptions and stereotypes; providing constructive feedback; reflection activities.

**University Engagement in the Community:** Provides an overview of the various activities that universities can undertake in the community, including the strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities inherent in each. The various activities covered include: research, planning, technical assistance, and programming.
