## Building Young Leaders

Engaging approximately 130 youth per year (ages 14-24), our programming is distinguished by its emphasis on long term development, its incorporation of youth leaders into the Collaborative’s organizational structure, its social justice/community building orientation and its location on a university campus.  This combination has created a large cadre of high school and college students who have followed the civic pathway to college and the college pathway to civic leadership.

## The Collaborative Continum

The Collaborative Continuum, a series of afterschool and summer programs, credit bearing internships, peer education activities, media production, and paid employment, is designed to keep older youth effectively engaged with us during their high school years and through their transition to higher education.  The overarching goal of the continuum is to foster young leaders by building the necessary foundations of confidence and self esteem, developing the 21st century skills upon which effective leadership rests, creating an awareness of larger social, economic and political issues, and nurturing the kinds of values that underlie a fair and just world.

### POPPYN

> “I learned how to operate the camera, break out of my shell and be comfortable with people.” - Tiffani

> “Working with POPPYN opened my eyes to what was/is going on around me.” – Briana

POPPYN — An award winning youth produced TV news program focusing on issues that impact youth while highlighting the positive contributions of youth to their communities.

POPPYN (Presenting on Perspective On Philly Youth News) is an award-winning youth news program based in Philadelphia. We cover events and explore topics of interest to youth in Philly.  POPPYN derived from the desire to portray the positive things youth are doing in the city, because local news tends to portray young people in a negative light.  In our program high school students collaborate with college students to produce a 30 minute episode, four times per year.  Youth producers meet on Monday evenings and shoot and edit based on availability. Prior video experience is not necessary.

POPPYN airs every Thursday at 4:30pm EST on Philadelphia’s Public Access Channel: PhillyCAM (Comcast 66/Verizon 29). Episodes and segments are also [available online](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=X6-iaAOB2ko).

For more information, please contact POPPYN Coordinator Nuala at [215-204-3871](tel:2152043871) or [nuala.cabral@temple.edu](mailto:nuala.cabral@temple.edu).

### Leaders Corps

**Leaders Corps** provides paid leadership positions within The Collaborative for former program participants to facilitate all youth leadership programs, assist in training and technical assistance activities and participate in other aspects of the organization.

> “Working with The Collaborative I’ve learned that empowering youth is the most meaningful action I can take.  To do so successfully, I have to be prepared, organized, and a responsible leader.”  – Leader Corps Member

All programming is implemented by our Leaders Corps, a dynamic team of former program participants who are now college students serving as de-facto role models for younger cohorts. Leaders Corps members receive ongoing support and professional development that prepares them to facilitate Collaborative programs, support training and technical assistance at other organizations, and conduct workshops in the community and at professional conferences.  In addition to developing participants’ skills, leadership, and confidence, this practice has shaped career and educational aspirations. Many of our former Leaders Corps members are teaching in Philadelphia and other cities and working in the nonprofit and public sectors. Additionally, many have pursued policy-oriented graduate and law school programs. These alums have taken their leadership on the road, helping to inspire a new generation of social justice leaders. Their example also serves as a powerful motivator for high school students who see in it the civic pathway to college and the college pathway to leadership.

### Leadership Development Institute

**Leadership Development Institute** is an intensive 2 week summer program through which participants learn the core principles of positive youth development, networking, community outreach, mentorship, youth organizing and use of media as an instrument in building community and driving social change.

> “I am using some of the strategies I learned in the LDI at my current college. There are very few minorities and I want to start a student organization to address some of our concerns. I want to make positive social changes in every community I belong to.”

Participants who have been through VOICES, POWER or YAS and who demonstrate a readiness to assume a leadership role within the Collaborative or in other organizations can apply to the Leadership Development Institute.  Grounded in the Collaborative’s philosophy of positive youth leadership development and social justice, the Institute provides intensive training in group facilitation, project development and management, curriculum design and implementation, community outreach and networking, media as a tool for positive social change, and working with diverse populations.  Successful graduates can apply for a paid position on the Leaders Corps.  The LDI meets for 2 weeks, 25 hours per week in the summer.  Enrollment is typically between 8-12 participants.

### Youth Action Scholars

Youth Action Scholars provides the next step for youth who have completed VOICES or the POWER Internship. Over the course of a year, participants form a team to identify an issue, conduct related research to become experts in the topic, and raise awareness through community educational workshops and events.

> “Youth Action Scholars allowed me to get the field work I needed to pass my senior project.  It also taught me about teamwork, accountability and reliability.  The staff here is great, they are incredibly helpful and informative.” -YAS participant, 2010

For youth who have gone through VOICES or POWER, this year long program equips students with the skills and ability to become Peer Educators.  Through research and networking, Youth Action Scholars educate themselves on a topic and then develop and conduct workshops to raise awareness amongst their peers.  Through these various activities, Youth Action Scholars hope to build communities of interest and engagement. YAS meets one day per week for 3 hours.

> “Ever since I joined the Youth Action Scholars, I have gained skills to better myself as a leader.  In my school, I have begun to help people understand things that I have learned…The Leaders Corps and staff have supported me wonderfully.  In don’t  think anything can be done to better support me.”  -YAS participant, 2010

> “As long as I work in Philadelphia, I will always connect students with POWER and the Collaborative. They do such a magnificent job immersing young people in vital skill and citizenship development activities.” — Philadelphia High School Teacher

For high school juniors and seniors, this credit bearing Internship integrates exposure to nonprofit work environments with a deepening of civic commitment and social inquiry and a broadening of research, media literacy and technological skills. The curriculum provides content based learning in local politics and government, social movements, and issues of race, class and gender. Through collaborative project based learning, students apply the research, critical thinking, communication and technology skills they have developed to timely issues such as youth homelessness, youth as victims of violence, youth in popular culture, and the like, usually producing a [Public Service Announcement (PSA)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9AqDPxQdbj8) or longer length film that is publicly screened and discussed.  Students also have opportunities to shadow Collaborative and university staff as well as college student leaders from across the city, thereby gaining a fuller picture of various professional and leadership opportunities and what they entail.  POWER meets one afternoon per week for 20 weeks for a total of 80 hours.

For more information please contact POWER Coordinator Nick at [215-204-3871](tel:2152043871) or [nicholas.palazzolo@temple.edu](mailto:nicholas.palazzolo@temple.edu).

Temple Youth VOICES seeks to build the individual and collective power of youth by integrating leadership development, community outreach and project based learning in a supportive, team environment.

> “I ask my son everyday how was school and I just get an ‘ok’, ‘alright’ or grunt… During his second week of VOICES I asked him “How was your day?” and he responded Great! That was the first time I ever heard that.” – Parent

> “This was very beneficial for my son, I think you created an environment of real team work and working as a group… No cool kids verses nerds or in-crowds” – Parent

As the main entry to our Continuum, VOICES seeks to build the individual and collective power of youth to make positive change in their communities.  Our program design achieves this through project based learning that is tied to community issues of importance to the youth; that places a heavy emphasis on teamwork and cooperation; that reaches out to community organizations as partners;  and that includes technological and creative arts components. Through this process, youth develop the cognitive, social and civic skills and knowledge necessary to be effective change agents.   Participants meet two afternoons per week from 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. on Temple’s campus and one Saturday per month for special activities. Summer programming is 4 days per week, 5 hours per day over six weeks. Participants are typically between 14 and 18 years of age. For more information, please contact Johannah Bennett.
