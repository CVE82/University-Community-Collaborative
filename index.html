<p>The Department of Greek and Roman Classics is the vibrant home to a host of dedicated faculty members and engaging undergraduate majors. The department offers programs leading to an undergraduate major or minor in classical languages and literature as well as a major in classical civilizations or minor in ancient Mediterranean studies.</p>
Students in the Department of Greek and Roman  Classics study the cultures and languages of two  major civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean world. They select from two major concentrations based on their interests and goals:

<p>- Classical Civilizations </p>
<p>- Classical Languages and Literature </p>

<p>Both options offer a sound liberal arts background — skills in critical thinking, reading, and expressing oneself fluently and with cultural sophistication — that prepares students for success in any career.
